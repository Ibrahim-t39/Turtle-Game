# Turtle Graphics Art Projects

## Short Description

Two creative Turtle Graphics projects using Python's Turtle module. The first project creates a random walk pattern with a turtle that changes color and direction. The second project generates a colorful spirograph by drawing circles with varying angles. Both projects were inspired by Angela Yu's Udemy course.

## Full Description

These Turtle Graphics Art projects demonstrate the use of Python's Turtle module to create visually engaging designs. Each project showcases different techniques for manipulating a turtle's movement, color, and speed to generate dynamic patterns.

### Project 1: Random Walk

In this project, a turtle named Tom performs a random walk across the screen. The turtle randomly changes its direction and color after moving a short distance, creating an unpredictable and colorful pattern. The turtle's movement is constrained to four possible directions: 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.

**Features:**
- **Random Colors:** The turtle's color changes randomly with each step, using RGB values.
- **Random Direction:** The turtle changes its heading to a random direction from a set of four angles.
- **Thick Pen Size:** The turtle draws with a thick pen size, making the pattern more prominent.

### Project 2: Spirograph

The second project draws a spirograph using the turtle. The turtle draws circles at different angles, gradually forming a complete spirograph pattern. The color of the turtle changes randomly with each iteration, adding to the visual appeal.

**Features:**
- **Random Colors:** The turtle's color changes randomly for each circle drawn.
- **Circle Pattern:** The turtle draws circles at varying angles to create the spirograph effect.
- **Smooth Animation:** The turtle moves quickly to smoothly draw the spirograph without delay.

**Note**: Both projects were inspired by Angela Yu's course on Udemy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The Turtle graphics module (usually included with Python installations).

### How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open each Python script (`random_walk.py` and `spirograph.py`) in your Python environment.
3. Run the script to see the turtle draw the respective patterns.

   ```bash
   python random_walk.py
   ```

   ```bash
   python spirograph.py
   ```

4. Watch as the turtle creates colorful designs on the screen.

### Customization

You can customize both projects by:
- **Changing Colors:** Modify the `random_color()` function to set specific colors instead of random ones.
- **Adjusting Motion:** For the random walk, change the list of directions or step size. For the spirograph, alter the gap size between circles.
- **Altering Shapes:** Experiment with different shapes instead of circles or straight lines to create unique patterns.
